# Warzone Easter Egg Helpers

A collection of web-based utilities designed to assist players in completing Call of Duty: Warzone Easter eggs.

This project is hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

[‚û°Ô∏è Open the Warzone Easter Egg Helpers Web App](https://koen-mulder.github.io/warzone_easter_egg_helpers/)

Once you open the web app, you can navigate to and select the specific Easter egg helper you need from the main page.

## A Note on Development (Vibe Code! üßë‚Äçüíª)

This is a **"vibe code" project**. The primary focus is on rapidly developing and delivering functional helpers, rather than on achieving pristine, production-grade code quality. The goal is to get useful tools into your hands quickly and iterate based on what works!

*   The web app components are primarily being developed using **Google Jules**.
*   The first iteration of the City Hall Metro Station Easter Egg helper was initially drafted with the assistance of **Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06 version)**.

Expect rapid changes, experiments, and a focus on functionality over polish in the codebase itself.

## Available Helpers

Currently, the following helper is live and ready to use:

*   ‚úÖ **[City Hall Metro Station Easter Egg:](https://koen-mulder.github.io/warzone_easter_egg_helpers/city_hall_metro_easter_egg/index.html)** Provides step-by-step guidance to help you successfully complete the Downtown City Hall / Metro Station Easter egg.

## Upcoming Helpers

Work is in progress on the following helpers:

*   üöß **Bunker 11 Easter Egg:** A guide to assist with the challenging sequence required to access Bunker 11. (Coming Soon!)

## How to Use

1.  **Click the link above** to open the web app in your browser.
2.  From the main page, **select the Easter egg** you wish to attempt.
3.  Follow the on-screen instructions and guidance provided by the specific helper.

## Contributing

Given the "vibe code" nature, contributions are welcome, especially if they help add new features or fix bugs quickly! If you have ideas for improving existing helpers, suggestions for new ones, or spot an error, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
